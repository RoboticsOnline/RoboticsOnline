		<h3 align="center"> Terms of Use </h3> 
		<ol> 
			<li> Specific terms for the use of online games </li>
				<ol>
					<li> The user is only allowed to have one account per game round (i.e. world, universe), unless the game rules explicitly state otherwise. The use of several user accounts is not permitted. Such multi-user accounts can be deleted or banned by RoboticsOnline at any time and in its sole discretion. </li>
					<li> The user is prohibited from any form of manipulative interference in the online game. In particular, the user is not entitled to use measures, mechanisms or software that could interfere with the function or the course of the game. The user may not take measures that may cause an unreasonable or excessive burden on the technical capacity. The user is not allowed to block, to rewrite or to modify contents generated by the game administration or to interfere in any other manner with the game.</li>
					<li> The user is also prohibited from running the online game (including all individual web pages) with other programs besides the Internet browser or the client program that has been provided. This refers in particular to so-called bots and other tools meant to replace or supplement the Web interface. Also prohibited are scripts and completely or partially automated programs that provide the user with an advantage over other users. This includes auto-refresh-functions and other integrated mechanisms of the Internet browser, if it includes automated operations.</li>
					<li> The user may under no circumstances </li>
					<ul>
						<li> create or use cheats, mods and/or hacks, and any other third party software products that may change the result of the online games,</li>
						<li> use software, that allows "data mining" or otherwise intercepts or collects information in connection with the online games,</li>
						<li> use outside of online games, buy for "real" money or sell or swap virtual objects that are used in online games.</li>
					</ul>
					This includes all evasions, similar actions or actions that match in their effect the aforementioned bans.
					<li> The application of advertising suppressing measures is prohibited. It is immaterial whether advertising is deliberately suppressed or generally blocked e .g. by so-called Pop-Up Blockers, or similar.</li>
					<li> Log-in is only permitted on the homepage of each online game and the RoboticsOnline portal page. An automated opening of the user accounts, regardless of whether the home page is displayed or not, is not permitted.</li>
					<li> RoboticsOnline or by RoboticsOnline authorized contractors exclusively have all rights to objects used in online games and virtual objects provided at a charge. The same applies for user generated virtual objects. The user provides RoboticsOnline with spatio- temporal and textual unrestricted, exclusive right of use to such self-created virtual objects. This right includes in particular the rights to reproduction, distribution and processing. The user receives only a non-exclusive right of use to the virtual objects for the duration of the contract.</li>
				</ol>
			<li> Consequences of a breach of duty </li>
				<ol>
					<li> RoboticsOnline is not liable for damages resulting from a breach of duty by the user.</li>

						<li> publication of misconduct in the respective online game with mentioning of the user name,</li>
						<li> temporary or permanent blocking of a user from individual or all online games and content of RoboticsOnline Internet pages,</li>
						<li> exclusion of a user,</li>
						<li> issuing a temporary or permanent virtual ban from the house in the cases of violation of section 6, or</li>
						<li> immediate termination of the contract.</li>
					</ul>
